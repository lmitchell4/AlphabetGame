# Alphabet Puzzle Game

This is a puzzle game designed to help 
kindergarten and first-grade students learn the alphabet. The game board 
consists of a sequence of consecutive letters with some letters 
randomly missing. 
The player must use their knowledge of the alphabet to deduce which 
letters belong in the blank spots.

## How to Play

This program is designed to be run as an Eclipse project. After cloning or 
downloading the program, here is one way to run it:

1) Launch Eclipse. Select OK to use the default workspace.
2) In the Welcome panel, select "Import existing projects". Click the 
Browse... button, find the AlphabetGame directory and set it as the root 
directory. Click Finish. If you don't see the Welcome panel, you can also 
select File > Open Projects from File System.
2) Open the file AlphabetGame > src > default package > AlphabetGameApp.java
3) Run the application by selecting the Run button.

Next, select a difficulty level. Click and drag a letter from the gray area 
to one of the outlined boxes in the middle of the board. If it is the 
correct letter, it will snap into place. Once all of the missing letters 
have been filled in correctly, you will move on to the next level.

There are controls to start a new game (New Game), save your score (Save 
Score), view other players' scores (View Scores), and exit the game (Quit).
